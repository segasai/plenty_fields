User Prompts from Session (28 Jan 2026):

1. I would like you start the development of the tool that is similar to benty-fields website. Specifically this needs to be a local tool. It needs to be able to 1) fetch the most recent arxiv papers 2) Save the information about which days the arxiv has been looked at 3) Allow liking papers and saving that information 4) Sort the papers according the preference of the user, i.e. what he liked in the past. Please first develop the plan for this and how would you do that. The software should ideally be based on python. The webpage ideally would be very similar to benty-fields. Also I am not interested in the 'reading-group' part of the benty-field interface.
2. Sounds good. I am also only interested in astronomical arxiv only.
3. Okay. That is good. But it is missing the ability to see the list of previous days and which ones of those have been looked at, and which not (so I catch up missed days). Also by default the interface should only show the title, and should only show the abstract if I click 'show abstract' button.
4. It is good. You also need to add a link underneath each paper to access .pdf. Also Currently in ther interface you show two recent days. I think you want to be showing at least two weeks, and make it very clear which days were looked at, which not. I.e. background colour fill, rather than small red point.
5. Somehow when I looked at the newly fetched papers from say 2026-01-24 they have no score associated to them, so there does not seem to be any sorting.
6. That looks good. However I don't understand the 'fetch the latest 500'. Ideally I'd like to be able to go over maybe last couple of weeks of arxiv papers at least.
7. Can you also put in some logic to retire the very old papers, so the database does not get too large ? Maybe you can keep liked papers though.
8. Please now commit everything (not the database into git@github.com:segasai/plenty_fields.git ) you should not need any logins/passwords.
9. Thanks I think something is not quite right in the interface, since it shows Sun/Sat, while there are no Sun/Sat announcements.
10. I think something is not quite right with the abstract rendering. I.e. in 2026-01-16 posting. the 'FEAST' paper has the 'FeadbackinEmerging' etc as one word visible as an image rather then text.
11. The problem still remains and in the same abstract after 'in four nearby star forming galaxies' the name of galaxies seen as an image and glued together like latex mode.
12. The problem persists. and I see now 'extra close brace' messages as well in some cases.
13. Okay that seems better. Can you please commit the changes and push them to the repo.
14. In the current folder there is a png of the screenshot. Can you please refer it in the readme and commit to the repo, so people can see how this looks like directly on github.
15. Please now give me a short description that I should put in the 'About' section on github. Also please in the Readme, mention that this a local replacement of benty-fields. Please link it as well.
16. Privacy has nothing to do with it. It is just local.
17. Can you save all the prompts from this session into the log file in the current folder ?
