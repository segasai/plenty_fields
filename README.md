# ArXiv Local Recommender

A local web application to browse, like, and get recommendations for ArXiv papers (specifically `astro-ph`). This tool is designed as a local replacement for [benty-fields](https://benty-fields.com/).

The code was generated by the Gemini CLI agent. The prompts are provided in the LLM_prompts.md file.

## Features
*   **Local Database:** Stores papers and your interactions in a local SQLite file.
*   **ArXiv Fetcher:** Pulls the latest papers from `astro-ph`.
*   **Recommender:** Uses TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to recommend papers based on your likes.
*   **Interface:** Clean, Benty-Fields inspired list view with MathJax support.

## Installation

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r arxiv_local/requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Start the Server:**
    You can use the provided script (make sure to run from this directory):
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```
    Or manually:
    ```bash
    nohup python3 -m uvicorn arxiv_local.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 > server.log 2>&1 &
    ```

2.  **Open Browser:**
